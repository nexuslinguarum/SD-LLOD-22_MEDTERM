# SD-LLOD-22_MEDTERM
This repo contains the miniproject on Medical Terminology developed during the SD LLOD 22 in Cercedilla.
Project description: given a corpus of 1000 clinical reports in Spanish, we tested 3 term extraction tools: TBXTools, TermSuite and Text2TCS. We implemented the latter since the quality of the results is higher. We afterwards postprocessed the results, using an exclusion gazettier of general words (not medical-specific) and exclusion linguistic patterns based on the POS tagging. This clean term list was afterwards enriched using DBnary and published in SKOS.
